# CartoonSing

CartoonSing explores voice modeling **beyond human imitation**. Instead of recreating natural human voice, we focus on generating novel, stylized, and creatively shaped voices that do not strictly exist in the real world. Our goal is to enable creative vocal exploration for experimental music, sound design, interactive media, and other imaginative applications.

## Project Status

We are gradually preparing and releasing training scripts, configurations, and documentation for public use. The codebase will be made available in stages as each part is ready.

### Coming Soon

- Training and inference source code
- Model configuration examples
- Dataset preparation tools and guidelines
- Pretrained models

More updates are on the way.
